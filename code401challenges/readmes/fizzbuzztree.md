# Challenge Summary
* Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
  Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
  If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
  If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
  If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
  Return the tree with its new values.
  
  For explicitly-typed languages: Ensure your node values are of type Object, to hold either strings or integers.
