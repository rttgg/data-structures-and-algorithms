# Tree Intersection
![breadthTraversal](../assets/treeintersection.png)
## Challenge
* Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
  Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, 
  return a set of values found in both trees.

## Challenge Description
* Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, 
  reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback
   and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.


## Approach & Efficiency
* Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
 
* Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
