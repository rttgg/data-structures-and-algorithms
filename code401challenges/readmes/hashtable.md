# Hash Tables
Implement a Hashtable

## Challenge
* add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, 
and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
* contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Challenge Description

## Approach & Efficiency
* all tests are passing

## Method()
