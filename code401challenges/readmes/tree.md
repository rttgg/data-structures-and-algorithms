###Code Challenge
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
* Create a BinaryTree class
* Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
* At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.

* Create a BinarySearchTree class
* Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
* Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.


###Code Method
* Class	Methods	Method Description
* BinaryTree = preOrder()	returns an array of the values in pre-order
* BinaryTree = inOrder()	returns an array of the values in order
* BinaryTree = postOrder()	returns an array of the values in post-order

* BinarySearchTree	= add()	accepts a value, and adds a new node
* BinarySearchTree = contains()	accepts a value, and returns a boolean
