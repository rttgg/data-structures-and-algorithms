# Hash Tables
* Find the first repeated word in a book.

## Challenge
* Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
* Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, 
 return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Challenge Description
* Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, 
* reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback 
 and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.


## Approach & Efficiency
* Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

* Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
