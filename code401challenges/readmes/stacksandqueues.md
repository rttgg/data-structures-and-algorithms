# Challenge Summary
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
* Create a Stack class that has a top property. 
* Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument 
* Define a method called pop that does not take any argument
* Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node
   
* Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node 
* Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument
* Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node

## Challenge Description
* Node properties should point to the next node.
* push should adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
* pop removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.
* Peek returns the value of the node located on top of the stack   
* enqueue adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
* dequeue removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
* peek returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, 

## Approach & Efficiency
* all tests are passing
