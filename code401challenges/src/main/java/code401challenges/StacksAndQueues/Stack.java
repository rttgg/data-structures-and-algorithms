//Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
//        This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
//        Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that
//        value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
//        Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of
//        the stack, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
//        Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node
//        located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
